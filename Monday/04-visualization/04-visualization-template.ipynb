    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we will use [fresnel](https://fresnel.readthedocs.io) to visualize snapshots. We will use a simple example of an atomistic molecule to begin with. This is not a complete fresnel tutorial, but it will give you a starting point. We also highly recommend to use other options ([Ovito](https://www.ovito.org/),[vmd](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/),..) for full simulation workflows. \n",

    "- Define a simple configuration of an atomistic and coarse-grained molecule.\n",

For this, define two sets of `fresnel.geometry.Sphere` (one for atomistic, one for coarse-grained) and tune their properties independently. When using transparent spheres, also use `fresnel.light.lightbox` and `fresnel.pathtrace`, other lights and `fresnel.preview` can have odd artifacts with transparend spheres."
