    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "Working in groups of up to three people, setup and perform mesoscale simulations\n",
    "to answer a research question. You can select one of the projects described\n",
    "below, or you can work on your own problem. If you would like to work on your\n",
    "own problem, please discuss your idea with us first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please report. Create a presentation of no more than three slides that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Motivates and defines your research problem.\n",
    "- Briefly explains the simulation setup and methodology.\n",
    "- Summarizes your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your group will have 5 minutes to present your work the following morning. Please\n",

    "## Effect of solvent quality on polymer structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Solvent quality influences the structure of a polymer chain and, in turn, its\n",
    "dynamics. Poor solvents cause the chain to collapse into a dense globule, while\n",
    "good solvents cause the chain to swell. The scaling exponent $\\nu$ for the\n",
    "radius of gyration $R_{\\rm g}$ with chain length $N$ is defined by\n",
    "$R_{\\rm g} \\sim N^\\nu$. For a poor solvent, $\\nu \\approx 0.33$; for an ideal\n",
    "solvent $\\nu = 0.5$; and for a good solvent, $\\nu \\approx 0.6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A top-down coarse-grained model for polymers in varying quality solvents can be\n",
    "constructed as a variation on the Kremer-Grest model. We will represent the\n",
    "polymer as a linear bead-spring chain with the same Kremer-Grest FENE bonds\n",
    "between beads, but now, the beads will interact through a\n",
    "[perturbed Lennard-Jones potential](https://azplugins.readthedocs.io/en/stable/module-azplugins-pair.html#hoomd.azplugins.pair.PerturbedLennardJones)\n",
    "that has an attractive tail whose strength can be tuned through the parameter\n",
    "$\\lambda$ instead of the purely repulsive WCA potential. When $\\lambda = 0$,\n",
    "this potential is the same as WCA; when $\\lambda = 1$, it is the Lennard-Jones\n",
    "potential; and when $0 < \\lambda < 1$, it has an attraction strength less than\n",
    "the Lennard-Jones potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like estimate the value of $\\lambda$ for which this model behaves like\n",
    "an *ideal* chain. Conduct simulations of a few different polymer chain lengths\n",
    "and a few different values of $\\lambda$ to create scaling plots of $R_{\\rm g}$\n",
    "and extract the exponent $\\nu$. Use the values of $\\nu$ you calculated as a\n",
    "function of $\\lambda$ to determine the value for which $\\nu = 0.5$.\n",

    "## Block copolymers\n",
    "\n",
    "Block copolymer micelles are generally formed by the self-assembly of either\n",
    "amphiphilic or oppositely charged copolymers in aqueous medium. These micelles\n",
    "can be spherical, cylindrical, or adopt more complex self-assembled\n",
    "morphologies. Micelles in particular have application in drug delivery or as\n",
    "building block for hierarchical self-assembled structures. Modify the\n",
    "Kremer-Grest model to make a simple AB block copolymer with one hydrophobic\n",
    "block (FENE+LJ) of length $N_A$ and one hydrophilic block (FENE+WCA) of length\n",
    "$N_B$. Simulate dilute solutions of polymers with varying degree of\n",
    "$f_A=N_A/(N_A+N_B). Find the range of $f_A$ and concentration that forms\n",
    "micelles. Use freud to calculate the size of each micelle by using the \"Cluster\"\n",
    "module. Compute the average radius of gyration of the micelles. Compute the\n",
    "diffusion coefficient of micelles as function of their size. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of a polymer in shear flow\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous exercises, you analyzed the structure (radius of gyration) of a\n",
    "Gaussian chain at equilibrium and performed MPCD simulations to simulate shear\n",
    "flow. The objective of this project is to examine how the structure of the\n",
    "Gaussian chain is perturbed in shear flow, which is a scenario that is\n",
    "commonly encountered in the rheological characterization of complex fluids.\n",
    "Perform simulations of a 50-mer Gaussian polymer chain under different flow\n",
    "conditions to vary the shear rate. Characterize the relative deformation along\n",
    "the direction of flow by computing the gyration tensor (see Eqs. 17 and 18 in\n",
    "[10.1021/ma101836x](https://doi.org/10.1021/ma101836x)). Determine the value of\n",
    "the Weissenberg number ${\\rm Wi} = \\dot \\gamma \\tau_{\\rm R}$, where $\\dot\\gamma$\n",
    "is the shear rate and $\\tau_{\\rm R}$ is the relaxation time of the chain,\n",
    "at which the chains being to elongate. If time permits, re-perform the analysis\n",
    "for different chain lengths and also characterize the alignment of the polymers\n",
    "with the flow via Eq. 19 in the same reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Drag coefficient of a cube\n",
    "\n",
    "Nanoparticles with a variety of shapes can be synthesized, but the transport\n",
    "properties of these anisotropic particles can be less well-understood than\n",
    "those of spherical particles. Evaluate the drag coefficient for a cube from an\n",
    "MPCD sedimentation simulation. Model one cube having edge length 6 using a\n",
    "discretized representation for each face as described in\n",
    "[Wani et al.](https://doi.org/10.1039/D4SM00271G). The surface particles should\n",
    "be bonded to their nearest neighbors and to a central particle. The same\n",
    "finite-size correction used for the sedimentation velocity of a sphere will\n",
    "also work for the cube. Compare your simulation results to the empirical\n",
    "correlation given by Eq. 9 of the same paper referenced above."
