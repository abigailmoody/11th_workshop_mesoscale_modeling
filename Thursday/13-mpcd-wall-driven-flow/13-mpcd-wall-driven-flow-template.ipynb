    "\n",
    "Wall-driven flow is created when a fluid is in contact with a moving surface. We\n",
    "typically assume that the fluid will have \"no slip\" relative to the surface such\n",
    "that it is required to move with the same velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose we have parallel plates at $y = \\pm H$ with normals in the *y*\n",
    "direction. We will make these walls move in opposite directions, with a fixed\n",
    "velocity $U$ in $+x$ on the \"top\" wall and $-U$ in $-x$ on the \"bottom\" wall.\n",
    "The motion of the walls should generate a flow in only the *x* direction that\n",
    "depends only on *y*. Assuming the MPCD particles act as an incompressible\n",
    "Newtonian fluid, the momentum balance that governs the flow, which is a\n",
    "second-order ordinary differential equation, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu \\frac{{\\rm d}^2 u_x}{{\\rm d}y^2} = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $u_x$ is the velocity in the *x*\n",
    "direction. The general solution to this differential equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_x = c_1 y + c_2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are unknown coefficients. No slip at the boundaries means\n",
    "that $u_x(\\pm H) = \\pm U$, so applying these conditions and solving for $c_1$\n",
