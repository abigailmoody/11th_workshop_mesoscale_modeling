    "Now we can compute the radius of gyration. For this, we do need to first unwrap the positions into an array called `unwrapped_positions`. Then, the positions need to be split (`numpy.split`) into seperate arrays, one per polymer. For this determine where the `polymer_delimiters` are, i.e. the indices of the breaks between the polymers.  Then we need to determine the center of mass of each polymer (`com`), and then calculate the $Rg^2$ of each polymer. Once the entire trajectory is processed, we can take the square root to get $R_g$ later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hints: \n",
    "1. For unwrapping the coordinates, you need to add `frame.particles.image*frame.configuration.box[0:3]` to the positions, since the `images` are integers keeping track of the number of image crossings. \n",
    "2. To compute the `polymer_delimiters` you can make a list manually, that holds the indices of the ends, for example for polymers of $N=80$, this list would be `[ 80 160 240 320 400 480 560 640 720]`, because the first polymer goes from index `[0-79]`, the next one from `[80-159]` etc. Of course you do not want to compute this manually, because then you would have to change this code every time you cange the chain length, so you need to find a way to do this automatically. One way to do this for linear polymer chains, is to look for \"breaks\" in the bond array. The bond array contains `[[0,1],[1,2],...,[78 79],[80 81],...]` where you can see that except for at the *end* of a polymer, the first index of one bond is identical to the second index of the previous bond. So if we use `numpy.where`, we can compute where the difference of  `bonds[:-1,1]-bonds[1:,0]` is NOT zero. \n",
    "3. for computing the center of mass `com`, you can use `numpy.mean`\n",
    "4. for comuting the $R_g^2$, radius of gyration squared, you can use `numpy.average` of the `numpy.sum`. What do you need to sum? Which axis do you need to sum over? \n",
